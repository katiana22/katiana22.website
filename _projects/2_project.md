Physical phenomena often occur over a wide range of length and time scales. The process of transferring information from low to high scales is known as *upscaling*. 
In this work, we introduce a framework for probabilistically parametrizing upper-scale models, in the form of non-linear PDEs based on data generated from lower-scale simulations (e.g., molecular dynamics). 

The proposed method can be applied to any kind of flow or deformation process and assumes the existence of a lower and an upper scale model that are capable of simulating the process at both scales. We also assume that a hypothesized framework is considered for coarse-graining of the atomistic data (e.g., via spatial averaging). 

Having a reference lower-scale simulation with associated model outputs (e.g., shear strain field of a material or velocity field for a fluid), we construct a training dataset from the upper-scale model by assuming an experimental design and the input stochastic parameters as probability distributions.

High-dimensional fields in the form of generalized tensors are projected onto a Riemannian orthonormal matrix manifold, called the **Grassmann manfiold**. The Grassmann projections allows us to address the "curse of dimensionality" by identifying a subspace structure of the high-dimensional data. We measure distances between the fields on the manifold and our goal is to minimize the distance of the upper-scale model's behavior from the reference response generated by the lower-scale model.

Given a set of training data, we perform Gaussian process regression (Kriging) to construct a surrogate model between the input stochastic parameters and manifold distances. Finally, we employ efficient gloabal optimization (EGO) to identify a set of model parameters capable of generating a response whose distance from the lower-scale reference is minimized.
