### Objective
Physical phenomena often occur over a wide range of length and time scales. The process of transferring information from low to high scales is known as **upscaling**. 
In this work, we introduce a framework for **probabilistically parametrizing upper-scale models**, in the form of non-linear PDEs based on data generated from lower-scale simulations (e.g., molecular dynamics). 

The proposed method can be applied to any kind of **flow** or **deformation process** and assumes the existence of a lower and an upper scale model that are capable of simulating the process at both scales. We also assume that a hypothesized framework is considered for **coarse-graining** of the atomistic data (e.g., via spatial averaging). 


### Method 
Having a reference **lower-scale simulation** with associated model outputs (e.g., shear strain field of a material or velocity field for a fluid), we construct a training dataset from the upper-scale model by assuming an experimental design and the input stochastic parameters as probability distributions.

High-dimensional fields in the form of generalized tensors are projected onto a Riemannian orthonormal matrix manifold, called the **Grassmann manfiold**. The Grassmann projections allows us to address the *curse of dimensionality* by identifying a reduced subspace structure of the high-dimensional data. We measure distances between the fields on the manifold and we aim to minimize the distance between the upper-scale model behavior and the reference response generated by the lower-scale model.

Given a set of training data, we perform **Gaussian process regression** (Kriging) to construct a surrogate model between the input stochastic parameters and manifold distances. Finally, we employ **efficient gloabal optimization** (EGO) to identify a set of model parameters capable of generating a response whose distance from the lower-scale reference is minimized.

### Results
The proposed method is employed to study plasticity in a **Cu/Zr metallic glass** system. Below we observe the optimized continuum response compared to the reference atomistic. A very good match is achieved for the evolution of all quantities of interest, i.e., the effective temperature fields, shear strain fields  and stress-strain curve.
