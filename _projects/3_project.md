Constructing probability densities for **high-dimensional spectroscopic data** is a challenging task. In this work we propose the use of **normalizing flows on spectral latent spaces** to enable **downstream inference** and **uncertainty quantification** for laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy data. We apply the proposed framework for probabilistic modeling of LIBS spectra generated by the **ChemCam instrument** on the **Mars Curiosity rover** and enable predictions with uncertainty estimates for the qualitative and quantitative chemical content of Martian material samples.
