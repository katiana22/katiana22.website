Constructing probability densities for high-dimensional spectroscopic data is a challenging task. In this work we propose the use of normalizing flows on spectral latent spaces to enable downstream inference and uncertainty quantification for laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy data. We apply the proposed framework for probabilistic modeling of LIBS spectra generated by the ChemCam instrument on the Mars Curiosity rover and enable predictions with uncertainty estimates for the qualitative and quantitative chemical content of Martian material samples.
