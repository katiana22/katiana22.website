Hey, thanks for stopping by! :wave:

I am a third-year PhD student in civil and systems engineering at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), where I am advised by [Michael D. Shields](https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/faculty/michael-d-shields/). My research is centered around scientific machine learning with a main focus on manifold learning and surrogate modeling for predictive analysis and uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional physics-based stochastic systems. My research is generously supported by the U.S. [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/) (DOE). 

During my PhD, I have spent time at DOE's [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) as an Applied Machine Learning Research Fellow. My research focused on the uncertainty quantification of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy spectra  generated by the [ChemCam instrument]( https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/instruments/chemcam/) of the [Curiosity Mars rover](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/), for analyzing the geochemical composition of Martian rocks and soil.

I am also a co-developer of [UQpy](https://github.com/SURGroup/UQpy) (Uncertainty Quantification with python) an open-source python package for modeling uncertainty in physical and mathematical systems.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports, painting, playing piano and spending time with my family in [Athens, Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens).
