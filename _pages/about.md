Hey, thanks for stopping by! :wave:

I am a final-year PhD student in [civil and systems engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), where I am advised by [Michael D. Shields](https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/faculty/michael-d-shields/). My broader research interests are in the intersection of data-driven modeling, uncertainty quantification and scientific machine learning. In particular, I am interested in surrogate modeling and operator learning in latent spaces for very high-dimensional problems as well as transfer learning, multi-task and multi-domain learning for partial differential equations describing phenomena from a wide range of applications in physics and engineering. My research at Johns Hopkins is generously supported by the U.S. [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/) (DOE). 

During my PhD, I have spent time at DOE's [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) as an Applied Machine Learning Research Fellow, focusing on generative modeling and uncertainty quantification for [laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy spectra]( https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/instruments/chemcam/). In Summer 2022, I joined [GE Research](https://www.ge.com/research/) as a Research Engineer Intern with a focus on probabilistic modeling to provide solutions for GE Aviation, Power, and Renewable businesses. Recently, I was selected as a [Rising Star in Computational and Data Sciences](https://risingstars.oden.utexas.edu/) from UT Austin's Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Science. Please refer to my curriculum vitae and my publications page to learn more about my background and research experience.

I am also a co-developer of [UQpy](https://github.com/SURGroup/UQpy) (Uncertainty Quantification with python) an open-source python package for modeling uncertainty in physical and mathematical systems.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports, painting, playing piano and spending time with my family in [Athens, Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens).
