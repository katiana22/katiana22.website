I'm excited to share our latest project "[On the influence of over-parameterization in manifold based surrogates and deep neural operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05071)" in collaboration with
[Dr. Somdatta Goswami](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GaKrpSkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. George Em Karniadakis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yZ0-ywkAAAAJ&hl=en) from Brown University.
