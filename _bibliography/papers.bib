  abstract={Constructing surrogate models for uncertainty quantification (UQ) on complex partial differential equations (PDEs) having inherently high-dimensional (10≥2) stochastic inputs (e.g., forcing terms, boundary conditions, initial conditions) poses tremendous challenges. The curse of dimensionality can be addressed with suitable unsupervised learning techniques used as a pre-processing tool to encode inputs onto lower-dimensional subspaces while retaining its structural information and meaningful properties. In this work, we review and investigate thirteen dimension reduction methods including linear and nonlinear, spectral, blind source separation, convex and non-convex methods and utilize the resulting embeddings to construct a mapping to quantities of interest via polynomial chaos expansions (PCE). We refer to the general proposed approach as manifold PCE (m-PCE), where manifold corresponds to the latent space resulting from any of the studied dimension reduction methods. To investigate the capabilities and limitations of these methods we conduct numerical tests for three physics-based systems (treated as black-boxes) having high-dimensional stochastic inputs of varying complexity modeled as both Gaussian and non-Gaussian random fields to investigate the effect of the intrinsic dimensionality of input data. We demonstrate both the advantages and limitations of the unsupervised learning methods and we conclude that a suitable m-PCE model provides a cost-effective approach compared to alternative algorithms proposed in the literature, including recently proposed expensive deep neural network-based surrogates and can be readily applied for high-dimensional UQ in stochastic PDEs.},

  abstract={In this paper, a novel surrogate model based on the Grassmannian diffusion maps (GDMaps) and utilizing geometric harmonics is developed for predicting the response of engineering systems and complex physical phenomena. The method utilizes the GDMaps to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the underlying behavior of physical/mathematical systems with respect to uncertainties in the input parameters. Using this representation, geometric harmonics, an out-of-sample function extension technique, is employed to create a global map from the space of input parameters to a Grassmannian diffusion manifold. Geometric harmonics is also employed to locally map points on the diffusion manifold onto the tangent space of a Grassmann manifold. The exponential map is then used to project the points in the tangent space onto the Grassmann manifold, where reconstruction of the full solution is performed. The performance of the proposed surrogate modeling is verified with three examples. The first problem is a toy example used to illustrate the development of the technique. In the second example, errors associated with the various mappings employed in the technique are assessed by studying response predictions of the electric potential of a dielectric cylinder in a homogeneous electric field. The last example applies the method for uncertainty prediction in the strain field evolution in a model amorphous material using the shear transformation zone (STZ) theory of plasticity. In all examples, accurate predictions are obtained, showing that the present technique is a strong candidate for the application of uncertainty quantification in large-scale models.},

  abstract={Constructing probability densities for inference in high-dimensional spectral data is often intractable. In this work, we use normalizing flows on structured spectral latent spaces to estimate such densities, enabling downstream inference tasks. In addition, we evaluate a method for uncertainty quantification when predicting unobserved state vectors associated with each spectrum. We demonstrate the capability of this approach on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy data collected by the ChemCam instrument on the Mars rover Curiosity. Using our approach, we are able to generate realistic spectral samples and to accurately predict state vectors with associated well-calibrated uncertainties. We anticipate that this methodology will enable efficient probabilistic modeling of spectral data, leading to potential advances in several areas, including out-of-distribution detection and sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract={We introduce a generalized machine learning framework to probabilistically parameterize upper-scale models in the form of nonlinear PDEs consistent with a continuum theory, based on coarse-grained atomistic simulation data of mechanical deformation and flow processes. The proposed framework utilizes a hypothesized coarse-graining methodology with manifold learning and surrogate-based optimization techniques. Coarse-grained high-dimensional data describing quantities of interest of the multiscale models are projected onto a nonlinear manifold whose geometric and topological structure is exploited for measuring behavioral discrepancies in the form of manifold distances. A surrogate model is constructed using Gaussian process regression to identify a mapping between stochastic parameters and distances. Derivative-free optimization is employed to adaptively identify a unique set of parameters of the upper-scale model capable of rapidly reproducing the system’s behavior while maintaining consistency with coarse-grained atomic-level simulations. The proposed method is applied to learn the parameters of the shear transformation zone (STZ) theory of plasticity that describes plastic deformation in amorphous solids as well as coarse-graining parameters needed to translate between atomistic and continuum representations. We show that the methodology is able to successfully link coarse-grained microscale simulations to macroscale observables and achieve a high-level of parity between the models across scales.},

  abstract={An important part of the design of steel structures is the analysis and design of the various connections. In general, beam to column connections of I profiles along the strong axis are usually bolted end plate ones. Although connections along the weak axis of the column are typically designed as simple ones, in certain cases it is necessary for them to be able to carry moments. The connection of the beam directly to the web of the column may lead to construction difficulties, especially in the case that a strong axis connection exists at the same position. An alternative is to use two end plates so that the beam is connected to the two flanges of the column. In this case however, due to the lack of guideline in the relevant Eurocode 3 part 1-8 [1], the design of such a connection may be a cumbersome procedure. An alternative design approach is to employ numerical models. The scope of this study is the investigation of the behavior of such a connection by the means of detailed numerical models, capable of taking into account the different phenomena that may arise, such as material nonlinearity and contact between the various connection components. The investigation focuses on the impact of the thickness of the end-plates and stiffener and the grade and diameter of the bolts on the capacity and ductility of the studied connection. After testing various configurations, a full-strength connection was finally achieved. Finally, conclusions regarding the applicability of the FEA on such connections and the advantages in the use of the proposed configuration are presented.},

  abstract={In this work we introduce a manifold learning-based method for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in systems describing complex spatiotemporal processes. Our first objective is to identify the embedding of a set of high-dimensional data representing quantities of interest of the computational or analytical model. For this purpose, we employ Grassmannian diffusion maps, a two-step nonlinear dimension reduction technique which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify meaningful geometric descriptions in a parsimonious and inexpensive manner. Polynomial chaos expansion is then used to construct a mapping between the stochastic input parameters and the diffusion coordinates of the reduced space. An adaptive clustering technique is proposed to identify an optimal number of clusters of points in the latent space. The similarity of points allows us to construct a number of geometric harmonic emulators which are finally utilized as a set of inexpensive pre-trained models to perform an inverse map of realizations of latent features to the ambient space and thus perform accurate out-of-sample predictions. Thus, the proposed method acts as an encoder-decoder system which is able to automatically handle very high-dimensional data while simultaneously operating successfully in the small-data regime. The method is demonstrated on two benchmark problems and on a system of advection-diffusion-reaction equations which model a first-order chemical reaction between two species. In all test cases, the proposed method is able to achieve highly accurate approximations which ultimately lead to the significant acceleration of UQ tasks.},

  abstract={We perform one and two-parameter numerical bifurcation analysis of a mechanotransduction model approximating the dynamics of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into neurons, adipocytes, myocytes and osteoblasts. For our analysis, we use as bifurcation parameters the stiffness of the extracellular matrix and parameters linked with the positive feedback mechanisms that up-regulate the production of the YAP/TAZ transcriptional regulators (TRs) and the cell-substrate adhesion area. Our analysis reveals regimes of hysteresis and multistability, stable oscillations of the effective adhesion area, the YAP/TAZ TRs and the PPAR receptors associated with the adipogenic fate, as well as homoclinic bifurcations that interrupt high-amplitude oscillations abruptly. The two-parameter bifurcation analysis of the Andronov–Hopf points that give birth to the oscillating patterns predicts their existence for soft extracellular substrates, a regime that favours the neurogenic and the adipogenic cell fate. Furthermore, in these regimes, the analysis reveals the presence of homoclinic bifurcations that result in the sudden loss of stable oscillations of the cell-substrate adhesion towards weaker adhesions and high expression levels of the gene encoding Tubulin beta-3 chain, thus favouring the phase transition from the adipogenic to the neurogenic fate.},
